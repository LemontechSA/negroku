Negroku
=======

Negroku is an opinionated collection of recipes for capistrano.

The goal is to be able to deploy **ruby on rails applications** and **static websites** without the hassle of configure and define all the stuff involved in an application deployment.

All the server configurations pre-defined in the configuration files generated by negroku are targeted oto this generic [configuration guide](https://github.com/platanus/guides/tree/master/deployment).

## This is a rewrite that will use capistrano 3

## Notes
We are using the gems installed per project and defined in the gemfiles
So is not necessary to globally install unicorn or eye
